## Why Fault Modeling?

<img src="Fault%20Model%201b7da2873a128083a27af161730f8e36/image%203.png" width=550/>

## Stuck-at Faults

### Single Stuck-at Faults (SSFs or S@1/0 Faults)
* One signal line (net) in the network of logic gates is fixed to logic 0 or logic 1
	* 2 SSFs (s@1 or s@0) per node
* Short Circuits: A short between a node and power (Vdd) or ground (Gnd)
* Impurities: During fabrication, dust particles can disrupt circuit behavior and result
* Physical Damage:
	* Thermal Stress:
		* Excessive heat can damage transistors or interconnects, causing permanent faults.
	* Mechanical Damage:
		* Handling errors, such as during packaging or mounting on a PCB, can damage the circuit and lead to faults.

### Multiple Stuck-at Faults (MSFs)

- Each node got 3 possible states: sa1, sa0, fault-free
- Single stuck-at fault model can detect most of the MSFs (except for the masked faults)
    - Fault Masking: Fault f2 mask fault f1, if 
    A test for f1 fails to detect f2, in the presense of f2.

## Bridging Faults (BFs)

- **Fault extraction**: There’re too many BFs in a circuit, so we need a physical tool to inspect where is more likely to have BFs due to neighbor signals

<img src="Fault%20Model%201b7da2873a128083a27af161730f8e36/image%205.png" width=550/>

- BF does not consider Shorts to power or ground (they are counted as s@ faults)
- BF does not consider intra-cell (intra-gate) defects, because BF is gate-level, not transistor-level fault model
- BF does not distinguish b/w **fanout stem** and **branches (unlike s@ faults)**
    - E.g., Both the input of $G_2$   are $A*(B+C)$, so $G_2$  is quivalent to a logic 1

<img src="Fault%20Model%201b7da2873a128083a27af161730f8e36/image%206.png" width=550/>

- BF is **not transient fault,** it is a **Permanent faults**
    - **Transient fault**: Not always present, which is induced by environmental (Electromagnetic interference , EMI) or internal (IR drop) disturbance
        - E.g., crosstalk faults caused by coupling effect
    - **Permanent faults**: Faults that always present; caused by defects, e.g., particle defects

### Wired-OR/-AND Models

<img src="Fault%20Model%201b7da2873a128083a27af161730f8e36/image%207.png" width=550/>

### SSF Test Sets for BFs

- Not good enough, because **the feedback BFs are not detected**
- We have to apply wire-OR/-AND BF models to detect the feedback BFs

Slow-to-fall delay falut

- Crosstalk: Design mistakes which the two wires are put too close to each other
- How to detect delay faults?
    - Global delay fault: Test the frequency of the monitor

### Path Delay Fault (PDF) Model

- Assume that there’re small delay fault (extra time) distribuited along paths
    - **It is a more realistic model, compared to the TDF model**
- The distributed faults slow down the signal, and cause the signals operating in wrong speed (consequently the signals will not be read at right time)
- More accurate, but complicated
- Two PAFs for **each PATH**: Rising ↑ & Falling ↓
    - Number of total faults: In worst-case, taking exponential time to exaustively test all paths, so usually only the paths on the **path-list** are considered

### Transition Delay Fault (TDF) Model

- Assume there is  a large fault (extra time) lumped at a node (site)
- Only focusing on the fault site, no need to consider the path delay
- Simple, but not accurate
- Two TDFs for **each** **NODE:** Slow-to-Rise (STR) fault & Slow-to-Fall (STF) fault
    - Number of total faults: **Linear** to circuit size
- Comparison
    - PDF model is more accurate, but complicated to implement for ATPG;
    - TDF is less accurate, so it is easier for ATPG

## **Limits of Fault Models (Unmodeled Faults)**

- Def: While achieving **100% FC for a specific fault model** (e.g., stuck-at faults) ensures all faults of that type are tested, it **does not guarantee the detection of faults or errors outside the scope of that model**.
- **Root Cause**: Faults are actually **ABSTRACTIONs of the defects**, so faults can’t 100% reflect the physical-level defects in digital ciruits
- Real-World Defects Beyond the Model: **Manufacturing defects** or **environmental issues**
    - Process Variation, e.g., timing variation causes timing violations
    - Aging-related issues (electromigration, time-dependent dielectric breakdown).

## LoS & LoC (Detecting Delay Faults)

### LoS (Launch on Shift, Skewed-load Test)

<img src="Fault%20Model%201b7da2873a128083a27af161730f8e36/IMG_0256.jpeg" width=550/>

- The transition is launched at $t_4$ (while in TEST MODE, aka SHIFTING TESTING PATTERNS)
- Procedure of LoS:
    1. Test Mode (Slow clock)
        1. To initiate the transition, scan-in the first vector in FFs in test mode ($t_0$ to $t_3$)
        2. To launch the transition, pulse one more clock to obtain the second vector 
            - The transition is launched at $t_4$ while **the FFs are capturing data from the preceding FFs, where the FFs are shifting data**, ****hence it’s called LAUNCH **ON SHIFT**
        3. Deassert SE, enter function mode (fast clock)
    2. Function Mode
        1. Pulse one clock to **capture** the test result (H/L) in FF4
        2. Assert SE, go back to test mode to scan-out the H/L in FF4
    3. Test Mode
        1. Pulse the clock to scan-out the result
- Since SE is a global signal, consequently, to de/assert the signal, it might suffer from long delay as it takes time from the PI to the FFs, then cause incorrect test result (false positive or false negative).
    - If SE pull-down dealy > path/gate delay, the capture clock cannot capture the fault.

- Procedure of LoC:
    1. Test Mode (Slow clock)
        1. To **initiate** the transition, scan-in the first vector in FFs in test mode ($t_0$ to $t_5$) ↔ **Load bombs into cannons**
        2. Deassert SE, enter function mode (fast clock)
    2. Function Mode (Fast clock)
        1. To **launch** the transition, pulse one clock to obtain the second vector in FF3 & FF4 ↔ Fire the cannons
            - The transition is **launch at $t_6$**, i.e., ****launch **while the FFs are capturing data from the preceding combinational logics**, ****hence it’s called LAUNCH **ON CAPTURE**
        2. Pulse one more clock to **capture** the test result (H/L) in FF5 ↔ Fire one more time
        3. Assert SE, go back to test mode to scan-out H/L in FF5
    3. Test Mode
        1. Pulse the clock to scan-out the result
